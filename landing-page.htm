                Quarantine has separated us, but art can connect us. 
                Here at PaintBrush Art Studio, we took it upon ourselves 
                to create a community of art-lovers and artists. 
                During our three-day workshop, there will be endless 
                opportunities to explore art and work with others. 
            </p>
